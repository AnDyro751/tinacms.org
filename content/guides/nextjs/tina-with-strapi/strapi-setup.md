title: 'Setting up Strapi'
---

We've chosen to work with Strapi for this example because it's open-source and pretty easy to use and customize. I would expect that much of what we cover will apply to other CMS's. Feel free to take a look at [Strapi's documentation](https://strapi.io/documentation/v3.x/getting-started/quick-start.html) to help you along.

## Install Strapi Locally

Installing Strapi is simple, just run the following command.

```bash
yarn create strapi-app tina-strapi-server --quickstart
```

That's it! You've just installed Strapi locally ðŸŽ‰. A browser window has probably opened for you and is prompting you to create an administrator account. Before we do that, let's go ahead and make Strapi even easier to use by installing the GraphQL plugin. Hit `Ctrl+C` to shut down the server and then run the following command.

```bash
cd tina-strapi-server
yarn strapi install graphql
```

Now you can restart the server and set up your local administrator account.

```
yarn develop
```

> Keep in mind that the administrator account you create now will only be used for Strapi management. We'll be setting up separate accounts later to get access to the Strapi APIs.

## Create Some Content Types

We'll set up a simple blog with two content types: **Blog Posts** and **Authors**.

### Set up the Author Type

Our authors will be straightforward with only a `name` and a `picture` field. Open up the Strapi management console at `http://localhost:1337` and click on **Content-Types Builder** in the left-nav. Click on **Create a new collection type** and enter "Author" as the display name. Note that Strapi will automatically generate an API friendly name for whatever you input here.

Next, you'll be presented with all of the fields that you can add to your content type.

The two field types we'll use for an author are **Text** and **Media**.

Click on **Text** and enter "name" as the field name. Click on the **Advanced Settings** tab and make this field required. Easy enough!

Next, we'll click on **Add another field** and select the **Media** type. We're going to call this field "picture" and switch the type to **Single media**. Once again, move over to the **Advanced Settings** tab and change the allowed types of media to only allow images. Click on **Finish** and then click on **Save**. Strapi will quickly restart the server, and your content type will be ready to use.

> **Note**

> I'm choosing field names to best match what the Next.js starter will provide us with in later steps. If you want to name them something different, keep in mind that you might need to make some extra changes on the front-end

### Set up the Blog Post Type

Our Blog Post type is going to have fields for: a title, a slug, an excerpt, a cover image, a date, and a link to an author.
Create a new content type and call it "Blog Post" we'll start by adding the text and media fields:

1. Create a short-text field called "title." Make it required and unique. We will have Strapi automatically generate a slug from this field.
2. Create two long-text fields called "content" and "excerpt."
3. Create a new media field called "coverImage." It should only accept images.

Next, set up the slug field. Create a new **UID** field and call it "slug." Under **Attached field** select "title". Make this field required for a bit of added safety. The slug field will now be autogenerated from the title field, giving us a clean way to link to our posts in the future.

Create a new **Date** field, and name it "date." I'm making this a date-only field for simplicity..

Finally, we'll link our blog posts to authors. Click to add a new **Relation** type and choose the relation that says, "Author has many Blog Posts." This adds a field to both content types. This could end up being handy in the future if we ever want to add the ability to see all the posts an author has written..

After you've created all these fields, don't forget to hit the **Save** button.

## Create Sample Data

All that's left for our initial Strapi setup is to create some sample data.

Under the **Collection Types** section of the left-nav, click into Author and then **Add New Author**. This is all pretty self-explanatory, give your author a name and a _beautiful_ picture and then hit **Save**..

Now create some sample blog posts. I'd recommend two or three, so we can better demonstrate some features on the front-end when we get there. I'd recommend using a fun [lorem-ipsum generator](https://loremipsum.io/ultimate-list-of-lorem-ipsum-generators/) as a placeholder for your blog content. Don't forget to link these posts to the author that you previously created.

## Conclusion

That's the end of our general Strapi setup. We'll be coming back a few times to tweak some settings as the need arises. Let's get started setting up a front-end with Tina to use our shiny new Strapi back-end..
